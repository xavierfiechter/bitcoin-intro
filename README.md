###### Guiding Principles
- Starting simply and improving is better than than not starting at all
- It's more engaging to use tools before reading a detailed explanation
- Always keep full control of your bitcoin (use non-custodial tools)
- Stay focused and avoid scams (use bitcoin-only tools & services)

## Step 1. Get a Wallet
*Aim: Make and backup a bitcoin wallet*

1. 	Download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.wallet" target="_blank">Samourai Wallet</a> for Android or <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/" target="_blank">Blockstream Green wallet for iOS</a>.
2.	Make a new wallet and write down the words presented to you using pen and paper. These words act as a key to access your bitcoin.
3.  Make another copy of these words (again, using pen and paper) and put them both somewhere hidden/safe in your house.
4.	In the wallet, click receive and copy the address shown on screen, this can be done by clicking on the QR code.

-----

## Step 2. Buy some bitcoin
*Aim: Get a small amount of bitcoin*

- Only buy a small amount of bitcoin to start (in a later step we will improve your backup redundancy).
- These recommendations let you buy bitcoin quickly at the cost of reduced privacy.
- Buying Privately is detailed in a <a href="#step-12-buying-privately" target="_blank">later step.</a>

2. Evaluate below tables to determine which route seems most suitable given:


|                       | Route A       | Route B       | Route C       | Route D       |  
| --                    | --            | --            | --            | --            |
| Cost                  | Zero          | Zero          | Low           | **High**      |
| Time Requirement      | Low           | **High**      | **Mid/High**  | Low           |
| Setup Difficulty      | Low           | **High**      | Mid           | Low           |
| Downtime              | **High**      | Low           | Low           | Low           |


| Route | Ideal User | Positives     | Negatives     |
| --            | --            | --    | -- |
| A | Non-technical Beginner | Free, Easy and Quick | When your computer is off your node will not be running so when you do want to use it you will have to wait for it to sync.|
| B | Technical Enthusiast | Free | Requires significant time to setup & is technologically difficult if you have not used linux before.|
| C | Less Technical Enthusiast | Reasonably low cost & quick | Requires some time to setup though typically guides specify hardware making setup as simple as following instructions precisely. |
| D | Anyone who can comfortably afford this option | Quick and Easy | High cost compared to alternatives |
